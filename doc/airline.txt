*airline.txt*  Lean and mean statusline that's light as air

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                       *airline*

There's already powerline <https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline>, why yet
another statusline?

*  it's 100% vimscript; no python needed.
*  it's small.  i want the core plugin to be less than 200 lines as a rule.
*  it gets you 90% of the way there; in addition to all the standard goodies,
   it integrates with a variety of popular plugins, including:
  *  fugitve <https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive>
  *  syntastic <https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic>
  *  vim-bufferline <https://github.com/bling/vim-bufferline>
  *  unite <https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim>
  *  ctrlp <https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim>
  *  lawrencium <https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/vim-lawrencium>
*  it looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you
   can use unicode or powerline symbols.
*  it's fast to load, taking roughly 1ms.  by comparison, powerline needs
   60ms on the same machine.
*  it's fully customizable; if you know a little |statusline| syntax you can
   tweak it to your needs.
*  it's trivial to write colorschemes; for a minimal theme you need to edit
   9 lines of colors. (please send pull requests if you create new themes!)

NAME                                                          *airline-name*

Where did the name come from?

I wrote this on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a
good name :-)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *airline-configuration*

  let g:airline_left_sep='>'
<

* the separator used on the right side

  let g:airline_right_sep='<'
<

* enable/disable fugitive/lawrencium integration
>
  let g:airline_enable_fugitive=1
<

>
  let g:airline_enable_syntastic=1
<

>
  let g:airline_detect_modified=1
<

>
  let g:airline_detect_paste=1
<

* change the default theme
>
  let g:airline_theme='dark'
<

* enable/disable usage of patched powerline font symbols

  let g:airline_exclude_filenames = [] " see source for current list
<

  statusline modified
>
  let g:airline_exclude_filetypes = [] " see source for current list
<

* defines whether the preview window should be excluded from have its window
  statusline modified (may help with plugins which use the preview window
  heavily)
>
  let g:airline_exclude_preview = 0

CUSTOMIZATION                                        *airline-customization*

The following are some unicode symbols for customizing the left/right
separators, as well as the powerline font glyths.

>
  " unicode symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '»'
  let g:airline_left_sep = '▶'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '«'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '◀'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␊ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␤ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '¶ '
  let g:airline_fugitive_prefix = '⎇ '
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'ρ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'Þ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = '∥'

  " powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = ''
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_fugitive_prefix = ' '
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = ''
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = ' '

  " old vim-powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '⮀'
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = '⮁'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '⮂'
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = '⮃'
  let g:airline_fugitive_prefix = '⭠'
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = '⭤'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '⭡'
<

For more intricate customizations, you can replace the predefined sections
with the usual statusline syntax.

>
  " here are the the default values
  let g:airline_section_a      (the mode/paste indicator)
  let g:airline_section_b      (the fugitive/lawrencium branch indicator)
  let g:airline_section_c      (bufferline or filename)
  let g:airline_section_gutter (syntastic and readonly flag)
  let g:airline_section_x      (filetype)
  let g:airline_section_y      (fileencoding, fileformat)
  let g:airline_section_z      (percentage, line number, column number)

  " here is an example of how you could replace the fugitive indicator with
  " the current working directory, followed by the filename.
  let g:airline_section_b = '%{getcwd()}'
  let g:airline_section_c = '%t'
<

If there is a particular plugin or filetype that is not supported, you can
extend it by adding a function reference to the global array.  Here is an
example that you could add to your vimrc:

>
  function! MyPlugin()
    if &filetype == 'MyPluginFileType'
      let w:airline_section_a = 'MyPlugin'
      let w:airline_section_b = '%f'
      let w:airline_section_c = '%{MyPlugin#function()}'
    endif
  endfunction
  call add(g:airline_window_override_funcrefs, function('MyPlugin'))
