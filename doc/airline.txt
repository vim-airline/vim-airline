*airline.txt*  Lean and mean statusline that's light as air

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                       *airline*

vim-airline is a fast and lightweight alternative to powerline, written
in 100% vimscript with no outside dependencies.

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                  *airline-features*

*  tiny core written with extensibility in mind.
*  integrates with many popular plugins.
*  looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you
   can use unicode or powerline symbols.
*  optimized for speed; it loads in under a millisecond.
*  fully customizable; if you know a little |statusline| syntax you can
   tweak it to your needs.
*  trivial to write colorschemes; for a minimal theme you need to edit
   9 lines of colors. (please send pull requests)

NAME                                                          *airline-name*

Where did the name come from?

I wrote this on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a
good name :-)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *airline-configuration*

COMMANDS                                                  *airline-commands*

:AirlineTheme {theme-name}                                   *:AirlineTheme*
  Displays or changes the current theme.

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION                                        *airline-customization*

The following are some unicode symbols for customizing the left/right
separators, as well as the powerline font glyths.

>
  " unicode symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '»'
  let g:airline_left_sep = '▶'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '«'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '◀'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␊ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␤ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '¶ '
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = '⎇ '
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'ρ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'Þ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = '∥'

  " powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = ''
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = ' '
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = ''
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = ' '

  " old vim-powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '⮀'
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = '⮁'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '⮂'
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = '⮃'
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = '⭠'
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = '⭤'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '⭡'
<

For more intricate customizations, you can replace the predefined sections
with the usual statusline syntax.

>
  " here are the the default values
  let g:airline_section_a      (the mode/paste indicator)
  let g:airline_section_b      (the fugitive/lawrencium branch indicator)
  let g:airline_section_c      (bufferline or filename)
  let g:airline_section_gutter (syntastic, readonly flag)
  let g:airline_section_x      (tagbar, filetype)
  let g:airline_section_y      (fileencoding, fileformat)
  let g:airline_section_z      (percentage, line number, column number)

  " here is an example of how you could replace the branch indicator with
  " the current working directory, followed by the filename.
  let g:airline_section_b = '%{getcwd()}'
  let g:airline_section_c = '%t'
<

FUNCREFS                                                  *airline-funcrefs*

vim-airline internally uses funcrefs to integrate with third party plugins,
and you can tap into this functionality to extend it for you needs.

                                             *g:airline_statusline_funcrefs*
The g:airline_statusline_funcrefs variable is an array of funcrefs that get
invoked before the statusline gets overwritten for each window.  The following
is an example of how you can extend vim-airline to support a new plugin.
>
  function! MyPlugin()
    if &filetype == 'MyPluginFileType'
      let w:airline_section_a = 'MyPlugin'
      let w:airline_section_b = '%f'
      let w:airline_section_c = '%{MyPlugin#function()}'
      let g:airline_variable_referenced_in_statusline = 'foo'
    endif
  endfunction
  call add(g:airline_statusline_funcrefs, function('MyPlugin'))
<
                                                *g:airline_exclude_funcrefs*
The g:airline_exclude_funcrefs variable is an array that's returns 1 or 0 to
determine whether that particular window should be excluded from having its
statusline modified.  Here is an example:
>
  function! ExcludeFoo()
    return &filetype == 'FooType'
  endfunction
  call add(g:airline_exclude_funcrefs, function('ExcludeFoo'))
<

==============================================================================
WRITING THEMES                                              *airline-themes*

Themes are written "close to the metal" -- you will need to know some basic
VimL syntax to write a theme, but if you've written in any programming
language before it will be easy to pick up.

The |dark.vim| theme fully documents this procedure and will guide you through
the process.  The |jellybeans.vim| theme is another example of how to write a
theme, but instead of manually declaring colors, it extracts the values from
highlight groups.
