# vim-airline

Lean &amp; mean statusline for vim that's light as air.

# Rationale

There's already [powerline][b], why yet another statusline?

*  it's 100% vimscript; no python needed.
*  it's small.  i want the core plugin to be *less than 200 lines* as a rule (specifically adhering to the [open/closed principle][h]).
*  despite the small size, it is fully featured and already integrates with: [vim-bufferline][f], [fugitive][d], [unite][i], [ctrlp][j], [minibufexpl][o], [gundo][p], [undotree][q], [nerdtree][r], [tagbar][s] and [syntastic][e].
*  it looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you can use unicode or powerline symbols.
*  it's fast to load, taking roughly 1ms.  by comparison, powerline needs 60ms on the same machine.
*  it's fully customizable; if you know a little `statusline` syntax you can tweak it to your needs.
*  it's trivial to write colorschemes; for a minimal theme you need to edit 9 lines of colors. (please send pull requests if you create new themes!)

What about [old powerline][a]?

*  the old version still works well, but since it's deprecated new features won't get added
*  it uses different font codes, which makes it incompatible with other powerline bindings in the same terminal (e.g. bash, zsh, tmux, etc.)

# Why's it called airline?

I wrote the initial version on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a good name.  Thanks for flying vim!

# Installation

This plugin follows the standard runtime path structure, and as such it can be installed with a variety of plugin managers:

*  [pathogen][k]
  *  `git clone https://github.com/bling/vim-airline ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline`
*  [neobundle][l]
  *  `NeoBundle 'bling/vim-airline'`
*  [vundle][m]
  *  `Bundle 'bling/vim-airline'`
*  manual
  *  copy all of the files into your `~/.vim` directory

# Configuration

`:help airline`

# Integrating with powerline fonts

For the nice looking powerline symbols to appear, you will need to install a patched font.  Instructions can be found in the official powerline [documentation][t].  Prepatched fonts can be found in the [powerline-fonts][c] repository.

Finally, enable them in vim-airline by adding `let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1` to your vimrc.

# Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please do the following:

*  reproduce it with this [minivimrc][g] repository to rule out any configuration conflicts.
*  specify your version and patch level, as well as operating system (found with `:version`).
*  a link to a gist or your vimrc where it can be reproduced.
