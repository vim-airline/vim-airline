Introduction
=============

This fontpatcher is a modified version of the original patcher from the vim-powerline project so all credit goes to the creator of the vim-powerline plugin Kim Silkeb√¶kken (kim.silkebaekken+vim@gmail.com).

I can only take credit for modifying the script and symbol file so that it uses the new glyph codes in the range U+E000..U+F8FF, in other words the glyph codes that the new powerline project uses.

This script produces font that are both compatible with vim-airline and the new powerline plugin and all other related tools that use the new powerline glyphs.

Usage
=====

1. To use this script and patch the fonts you have to install fontforge built with python support: 

 - on Ubuntu and Debian this is: apt-get install python-fontforge
 - on ArchLinux: pacman -S fontforge

You should search Google for other supported distros and installation methods.

2. After installing the required software now we get to step 2, chosing and aquring the fonts to be patched. Once you have the fonts just create a temporary working folder and place the fonts inside. Copy the two included files "fontpatcher" and "PowerlineSymbols.sfd" without the quotes :) and paste them inside the working directory, the one that contains the fonts to be patched, now you are ready to patch the fonts.

3. To patch the fonts you just have to run the script from console

  - ./fontpatcher TheNameofTheFont.ttf 

The above command will produce a new font file ex: TheNameofTheFont-Powerline.ttf, that is the patched font.

4. After patchhing the fonts copy them to ~/.fonts and run fc-cache -vf to recache the fonts.

5. Set the patched font as the default inside your terminal emulator of choice and you are good to go.

Enjoy.
